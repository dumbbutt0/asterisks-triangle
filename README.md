* **Right triangle loop**
  <br>The firts program to show off is a simple one that first takes a character from user input and then an integer that specifies the number of times to loop it the nask if it wants to be ran again.<br>
  In making this program i got a chance to understand loops and conditions in c++ and was able to simplify it into simple functions outside the main() block.  [Right Triangle Source Code](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/cpp-trashbox/blob/main/right-triangle "Right Triangle")<br>

* **blackjack CLI game**
  <br>made a simple game of 21 that takes user input to decide to pull a card and go against a dealer. im gonna refine this but it was with no guide so its kinda dope in my opinion.<br>
  in doing this i learned about randomization and it really tested my conditional functions.
