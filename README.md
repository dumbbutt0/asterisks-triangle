* **Right triangle loop**
  <br>The firts program to show off is a simple one that first takes a character from user input and then an integer that specifies the number of times to loop it the nask if it wants to be ran again.<br>
  In making this program i got a chance to understand loops and conditions in c++ and was able to simplify it into simple functions outside the main() block.  [Right Triangle Source Code](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/cpp-trashbox/blob/main/right-triangle "Right Triangle")<br>

* **blackjack CLI game**
  <br>made a simple game of 21 that takes user input to decide to pull a card and go against a dealer. im gonna refine this but it was with no guide so its kinda dope in my opinion.<br>
  in doing this i learned about randomization and it really tested my conditional functions.

* **Simple HTTP request**
    <br>After hours of struggling with external libraries in an attempt to make a web parser i was unsuccessful (F*ck cmake) However i figured out on my own how to make a bare bones http request using curl in c++. ill definitely be using this in the future  [Http Request source code](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/cpp-trashbox/blob/main/curls.cpp "HTTP-Request")

* **Link grabber**
  <br>after giving up on external libraries i had a much simpler time just usimg the builtin regex and libcurl libraries to make request to whatever domain and then regex to extract links. Im still gonna learn how to use gumbo but something is better than nothing. [DumbLinks source code](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/DumbLinks "DumbLinks")

* **Number Guesser**
  <br>I created a program that will guess the number that your thinking of by using the midpoint algorithm `(1 + 100)/2 = 50` to eventually reach the number your thinking of [Number Guesser source code](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/cpp-trashbox/blob/main/number-guesser.cpp "Number Generator")

* **Directory enumerator**
  <br>Started off with a good program for enumerating paths in a website and also taught me how to use color in c++ and  how to read input from a file in order to do a task for each new line. [DumbBuster](https://github.com/dumbbutt0/DumbBuster "DumbBuster")
