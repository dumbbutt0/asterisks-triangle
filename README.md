* **Right triangle loop**
  <br>The firts program to show off is a simple one that first takes a character from user input and then an integer that specifies the number of times to loop it the nask if it wants to be ran again.<br>
  In making this program i got a chance to understand loops and conditions in c++ and was able to simplify it into simple functions outside the main() block.<br>
